# Abstract

Visual illusions are fascinating phenomena that have been used and studied by artists and scientists for centuries, leading to important discoveries about the neurocognitive underpinnings of perception and consciousness. Surprisingly, despite their strong historical importance as psychological stimuli, there is no dedicated software, nor consistent approach, to generate illusions and describe them. Instead, scientists have to craft them by hand in an idiosyncratic fashion, or use pre-made images not tailored for the specific needs of their studies. This, in turn, hinders the reproducibility of illusion-based research and narrows its possibilities and applications. With the aim of addressing that gap, ***Pyllusion*** offers a framework to manipulate and generate illusions in a systematic way, compatible with different output formats such as image files (.png, .jpg, .tiff, etc.) or *PsychoPy* [@peirce2007psychopy] stimuli.


# Introduction


Visual illusions have been observed for hundreds of years [@LuckieshVisualIllusions1965], many of which were described in print by Helmholtz (1856) in 1856 [@robinson1972psychology]. In general terms, a visual illusion can be thought of as the inaccurate perception of a visual stimulus or a given attribute, be it geometrical (size, shape, or angle), or another property such as colour [@muller1896lehre, @howe2005muller, @delboeuf1893nouvelle, @ebbinghaus1902grundzuge, @roberts2005roles, @adelson200024]. Often an illusory perception resists 'correction' in perception even after an observer has been made aware of the misperception. Novel illusions are still observed and have even cropped up on social media platforms, a famous example being 'The Dress Illusion' (see **Fig. 1**) as discussed by Schlaffke et al. (2015). See Ninio (2014), Luckiesh (1965), and Robinson (1972) for extensive collections of visual illusions.

It is thought to illustrate how perceptual priors (i.e., expectations regarding the lighting conditions) can bias our conscious representation of an object (see visual explanation - from Wikipedia - on the right).](figure1.png)

Entertainment value aside, illusions can serve a more practical utility. Visual illusions have helped scientists understand the architecture of the eye and its relationship with processes and structures involved further up stream in the brain, the dynamic interaction of these processes, and visual coding in the brain in general [@carbon2014understanding, @forte2005inter, @clifford2002perceptual]. Illusions such as the blind-spot or those associated with colour perception, orientation perception, and motion perception, have all been informative of neuronal activity/processes both at the level of the eye and the brain via the measurement of associated illusions  [@durgin1995filling, @webster1996human, @witkin1948studies, @mackay1957moving, @Holland1965, @curran2009hierarchy]. Visual illusions, and perceptual illusions more generally, are a powerful tool in human perception and brain research, which in turn can inform artificial cognitive systems design considerations [@carbon2014understanding, @boyce2020optimality].


- **Add review on psychopathology**
The use of visual illusions to demonstrate vestibular and contextual influences on visual perception [@corbett2006observer, @chen2015contextual, @roberts2005roles] has given rise to its relevance as clinical tools, such as being markers of, or being used to investigate typical integration processes through the lens of, schizophrenia [@clifford2014tilt, @thakkar2020stronger, @palmer2018perceptual]. Several studies have demonstrated a diminished susceptibility to visual illusions amongst schizophrenic individuals relative to healthy controls [@notredame2014visual, @king2017review]. Schizotypal subjects perform significantly better at making accurate judgements of contrasts under contextual suppression [@dakin2005weak], are less prone to the perception of illusory motion [@crawford2010perception], and are also less susceptible to visual size illusion [@uhlhaas2004evidence]. Contrasting preserved performance in perception tasks against a background of poorer cognitive task performance has been useful in ruling out the proposition that schizophrenics are characterized by a generalized cognitive impairment [@dakin2005weak; @tibber2013visual]. As different visual illusion tasks tap on distinct neurocognitive processes, researchers have also been able to elucidate specific perceptual anomalies that occur in schizophrenia - for example, while schizophrenics show resistance to contrast illusions, they are indistinguishable from healthy controls in judging brightness illusions [@tibber2013visual], arguing against a broad deficit in low-level perceptual integration. Some evidence underscore the role of high-level perceptual deficits in schizophrenia (i.e., problems in contextual processing which can be tested using the Ebbinghaus illusion, see [**Reference**]) but the lack of consistency in illusion methodologies has posed a significant challenge to expanding our theoretical understanding of schizophrenia [@king2017review].

Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is another clinical group that demonstrates a similar immunity to perceptual biases, supporting the theoretical proposition that autistic children are characterized by a global processing deficit [@happe1996studying]. In other words, autistic children are protected against the contextual influences of illusions in biasing perception, allowing them to perceive elements accurately in a local fashion [@mitchell2010susceptibility @walter2009specific, @gori2016visual]. However, parallel to the literature on schizophrenia, findings of illusion resistance amongst ASD has failed to replicate in several other studies using similar illusion tasks [@ropar1999individuals, @hoy2004weak].

<!--Performance on visual illusion tasks has been shown to be a surrogate proxy of visual hallucinations, moving diagnosis criterion away from the reliance of family and self-reports, such as being able to differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies from both Alzheimer's Disease and healthy controls [@uchiyama2012pareidolias]. Specifically, the former show a pronounced tendency to produce pareidolic illusions, which are complex visual illusions that result in the perception of meaningful objects (e.g., faces, animals) from ambiguous forms [@uchiyama2012pareidolias; @mamiya2016pareidolia].--> 





Despite its relevance to psychology and neuroscience, the field of illusion research lacks a dedicated software to generate and report the stimuli, in order for them to be reproduced and re-used by other researchers and studies. As several reviews have highlighted [e.g., @gori2016visual], a lack of a validated paradigm and the improper measurement of visual illusion sensitivity (especially amongst individuals with communication problems) may be preventing progress in our understanding of the distinct mechanisms that underlie psychopathology and other fields alike. This is particularly problematic in the context of the replicability and reproducibility issues recently outlined in psychological science [@topalidou2015long; @open2015estimating; @milkowski2018replicability; @maizey2019barriers]. Our software, **Pyllusion**, aims at addressing this gap by proposing and implementing a parametric framework for illusions generation.


# A Parametric Framework for Illusion Research


The core idea of this "parametric" approach proposed here and implemented in **Pyllusion** is to dissociate the parameters of an illusion from its rendered output. For instance, the Ponzo illusion (see **Fig. 2**) can be described in terms of properties of the "distractor" lines (what creates the illusion), such as the angle (related to the illusion strength), the color, width, etc. and properties of the "target" lines (what is affected by the illusion), such as the size of the smallest line, the objective difference of the ratio of their length, or their color, width, etc. This set of parameters can then be rendered in different formats with further format-specific characteristics (in the case of images, the image size, ratio, resolution, compression, etc.).

![The "parametric framework" for illusions originally implemented in **Pyllusion** aims at dissociating the *parametric* representation of an illusion (on the left) from its *rendered* representation, in this case as an image (on the right).](figure2.png)

This essentially allows researchers to describe, manipulate, process and share their stimuli in a minimal yet consistent way. For instance, researchers could report a *"linear modulation of the illusion strength between -15 and 15, resulting in a reduced reaction time of..."*, providing details about the remaining parameters, as well as the Python code used to fully reproduce their stimuli.

Moreover, this parametric approach is scalable and appears to work well with different kinds of illusions, as demonstrated in the software. Indeed, most of the (basic and historical) visual illusions appears to have relatively similar parameters (such as a feature - like the angle or the size of some shapes - related to the strength of the illusion, or the color of the "target" objects), which in turn allows for a consistent programming interface (API).

Interestingly, in most of the visual illusions, the strength of the illusion can be dissociated from the actual "difference" (which is impacted by the illusion). For instance, in the Müller-Lyer illusion (see **FIG ???**), the difference between the two horizontal segments can be modulated orthogonally from the angle of the "distractors" arrows. Allowing the researchers to easily manipulate these parameters open the doors for potentially interesting paradigms and experiments.



<!-- parametric representation -->


<!-- example, delboeuf parameters, show output of dictionary parameters. pass dict values into another function to generate either image or psychopy object -->

In the following section, we will describe with concrete examples how we operationalized such parametric approach in the **Pyllusion** software.


# Pyllusion
<!-- One paragraph about software stuff: where to find documentation, CI, link of repo etc. -->

**Pyllusion** is an open-source package in Python to programmatically generate illusions.


Although being a programming-based tool, users not familiar with Python or other languages can easily use it, as it requires minimal programming skills (one can essentially copy the few necessary lines from the documentation and tweak the explicitly-named parameters).

The package is implemented in Python 3 [@python3], which means that its users benefit from an large number of learning resources and a vibrant community.

<!-- Accessibility and documentation -->
*NeuroKit2's* source code is available under the MIT license on GitHub (*https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit*). Its documentation (*https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/*) is automatically built and rendered from the code and includes guides for installation and contribution, a description of the package's functions, as well as several "hands-on" examples and tutorials (e.g., how to extract and visualize individual heartbeats, how to analyze event-related data etc.). Importantly, users can add new examples by simply submitting a Jupyter notebook [@kluyver2016jupyter] to the GitHub repository. The notebook will automatically be displayed on the website, ensuring easily accessible and evolving documentation. Moreover, users can try out the example notebooks directly in their browser via a cloud-based *Binder* environment [@Jupyter2018]. Finally, the issue tracker on GitHub offers a convenient and public forum that allows users to report bugs, get help and gain insight into the development of the package. Our active collaborators range from academics, professionals and practitioners in the life sciences and engineering fields (See the “authors” section on the package’s documentation). Based on community feedback that we received (social networks, GitHub issues), *NeuroKit2* has attracted users of different profiles, ranging from those who are new to signal processing and programming to more experienced users.

<!-- Reliability and Evolution -->
*NeuroKit2* aims at being reliable and trustworthy, including implementations of processing pipelines that have been described in peer-reviewed publications. Details and references regarding those pipelines are available in the package's documentation. Many pipelines have been tested against established software such as *BioSPPy* [@biosppy], *hrv* [@HRV], *PySiology* [@PySiology], *HeartPy* [@HeartPy], *systole* [@Systole] or *nolds* [@nolds]. Additionally, the repository leverages a comprehensive test suite (using *pytest*) and continuous integration (using Travis-CI and GitHub actions) to ensure software stability and quality. The test coverage and build status can transparently be tracked via the GitHub repository. Thanks to its collaborative and open development, *NeuroKit2* can remain cutting-edge and continuously evolve, adapt, and integrate new methods as they are emerging.


providing a parametric framework for generating visual illusions in computerized neuropsychology and neuroscience experiments.


*Pyllusion* encompasses several different illusions, including the Delboeuf illusion, Ebbinghaus illusion, Müller-Lyer illusion, Ponzo illusion, Vertical–horizontal illusion, Zöllner illusion, Rod and Frame illusion and Poggendorff illusion.

*Pyllusion* is available on PyPI, a repository of software for the Python programming language and can be installed using pip.

It is not the first time that Python, illusions and cognitive science are brought together. In his book, *"Programming visual illusions for everyone"*, @bertamini2017programming indeed describes how to use *PsychoPy* to generate famous illusions. That said, it is rather presented as an fun introduction to programming and to Python, rather than a dedicated software for illusions *per se*.


```
pip install pyllusion
```

And loaded with a Python script with:

```python
import pyllusion as ill
```


## Step 1: Parameters



## Step 2: Rendering

<!-- pass parameters into an output generator (as images or psychopy objects, psychopy being the most common experimentation software in psychology) -->
<!-- two engines available in pyllusion as of now -->

*Pyllusion* encompasses a function-oriented philosophy based on the *psychopy* package. Each function is illusion-specific and hence, uniform function names (in the form `illusiontype_functiongoal()`) are used in the process of creating the illusion.
While the functions can be incorporated within a PsychoPy builder, it can also be used without a GUI - the following example demonstrates the latter in generating a Delboeuf illusion.
Parameters specifying the illusion difficulty and strength are generated using `*_parameters()` before executing the display via `*_psychopy()`.


### Images

```python

# Load package
import pyllusion as ill

# Create parameters
parameters = ill.delboeuf_parameters(difficulty=2, illusion_strength=1)

# Generate image from parameters
ill.delboeuf_image(parameters)
```

![Delboeuf Illusion generated by Pyllusion using `difficulty=2` and `illusion_strength=1` in `delboeuf_parameters()`](figures/example_delboeuf.PNG)


### PsychoPy

It is designed for specific integration within the *psychopy* [@peirce2007psychopy] package for PsychoPy experiment creation.


```python
# Load packages
import pyllusion as ill
from psychopy import visual, event

# Create parameters
parameters = ill.delboeuf_parameters(difficulty=2, illusion_strength=1)

# Initiate Window
window = visual.Window(size=[800, 600], fullscr=False,
                       screen=0, winType='pyglet', monitor='testMonitor',
                       allowGUI=False, color="white",
                       blendMode='avg', units='pix')

# Generate psychopy object from parameters
ill.delboeuf_psychopy(window=window, parameters=parameters)

# Refresh and close window
window.flip()
event.waitKeys()  # Press any key to close
window.close()
```


# Future Plans and Developments

*Pyllusion*'s source code and issue tracker are available at its GitHub repository (https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion) and the package is licensed under the MIT License.
It aims to be a project for facilitating the running of experiments in PsychoPy and is open for further collaboration in view of improvements in features and bug fixes.
<!--talk more about open science. plan to add more illusions and support to more output engines eg., neuropsydia, opensesame -->


Validation to see how the illusion strength values affect the perception.

While illusions are of number (there are even machine learning algorithms generating visual illusions [REF]), a subset of them is commonly used (for historical reasons mainly, as well as for their relative simplicity). This set of classical, well-described, illusions, such as the Delboeuf, the Ponzo [ETC], is the primary focus of ***Pyllusion***. That said, due to the open and collaborative nature of the software, new illusions can always be added depending on the needs of the community.
