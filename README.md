*A Python Module for Generating Visual Illusions*

</h5>

# Overview

Visual illusions are fascinating phenomena that have been used and
studied by artists and scientists for centuries, leading to important
discoveries about how conscious perception is generated by the brain.
Instead of crafting them by hand, the **Pyllusion** software offers a
framework to manipulate and generate them in a systematic way

## Installation

    pip install https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/Pyllusion/zipball/master

## Contribution

You have some ideas? Want to improve things, add new illusions, and help
us shake people‚Äôs brain? Let us know, we would be very happy to have you
on board :relaxed:.

## Features

### Delboeuf Illusion

The [**Delboeuf
illusion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delboeuf_illusion) is an
optical illusion of relative size perception, where circles of identical
size appear as different because of their surrounding context. The
illusion was named for the Belgian philosopher, mathematician,
experimental psychologist, hypnotist, and psychophysicist Joseph Remi
Leopold Delboeuf (1831‚Äì1896), who created it in 1865.

``` python
import pyllusion as ill

ill.delboeuf_image(illusion_strength=1)
```

### Ebbinghaus Illusion

The [**Ebbinghaus
illusion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion) is an
optical illusion of relative size perception, where circles of identical
size appear as different because of their surrounding context. The
illusion was named after its creator the German psychologist Hermann
Ebbinghaus (1850‚Äì1909), though it got popularized by Edward B. Titchener
in a 1901 textbook of experimental psychology.

``` python
import pyllusion as ill

ill.ebbinghaus_image(illusion_strength=1)
```

### Autostereograms

[Autostereograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram) are
images made of a pattern that is horizontally repeated (with slight
variations) which, when watched with the appropriate focus, will
generate an illusion of depth.

For instance, in the image below, the `autostereogram` automatically
adds a guide (you can disable it by setting `guide=False`), the two red
dots. Look at them and relax your eyes until you see a new red dot
between them two. Then, try focusing on this new red dot until it gets
very sharp and until your eyes stabilize. You should then be able to
perceive the letters **3D** as carved in the figure

It can take a bit of time to ‚Äúget there‚Äù, but once you are used to it,
it‚Äôs a mind-blowing experience ü§Ø

``` python
ill.autostereogram(stimulus="3D", width=1600, height=900)
```

![](docs/img/README_autostereogram1.png)

The function is highly customisable, and we can use a black and white
image as a **depth mask** (in this case, the [picture of a
skull](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/Pyllusion/docs/img/depthmask.png)
that you will see as emerging from the background), and customise the
pattern used by providing another function (here, the `image_circles()`
function to which we can provide additional arguments like `blackwhite`,
the number of circles `n`, their size range and their transparency with
`alpha`).

``` python
ill.autostereogram(stimulus="docs/img/depthmask.png",
                   pattern=ill.image_circles,
                   blackwhite=True,
                   alpha=0.75,
                   size_min=0.005,
                   size_max=0.03,
                   n=1000)
```
