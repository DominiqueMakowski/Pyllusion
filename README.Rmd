## Features

### Delboeuf Illusion

The [**Delboeuf illusion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delboeuf_illusion) is an optical illusion of relative size perception, where circles of identical size appear as different. The illusion was named for the Belgian philosopher, mathematician, experimental psychologist, hypnotist, and psychophysicist Joseph Remi Leopold Delboeuf (1831â€“1896), who created it in 1865.

```{python, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
import pyllusion as ill

ill.delboeuf_image(illusion_strength=1)
```
```{python message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
import pyllusion as ill

img = ill.delboeuf_image(illusion_strength=1)
img.save("docs/img/README_delboeuf1.png")
```

### Autostereograms

[Autostereograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram) are images made of a pattern that is horizontally repeated (with slight variations) which, when watched with the appropriate focus, will generate an illusion of depth.

For instance, in the image below, the `autostereogram` automatically adds a guide (you can disable it by setting `guide=False`), the two red dots. Look at them and relax your eyes until you see a new red dot between them two. Then, try focusing on this new red dot until it gets very sharp and until your eyes stabilize. You should then be able to perceive the letters **3D** as carved in the figure

It can take a bit of time to "get there", but once you are used to it, it's a mind-blowing experience ðŸ¤¯


```{python, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ill.autostereogram(stimulus="3D", width=1600, height=900)
```
```{python message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
img = ill.autostereogram(stimulus="3D", width=1600, height=900, font="arial.ttf", blur=0.001)
img.save("docs/img/README_autostereogram1.png")
```

The function is highly customisable, and we can use a black and white image as a **depth mask** (in this case, the [picture of a skull](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/Pyllusion/docs/img/depthmask.png) that you will see as emerging from the background), and customise the pattern used by providing another function (here, the `image_circles()` function to which we can provide additional arguments like `blackwhite`, the number of circles `n`, their size range and their transparency with `alpha`).

```{python, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ill.autostereogram(stimulus="docs/img/depthmask.png",
                   pattern=ill.image_circles,
                   blackwhite=True,
                   alpha=0.75,
                   size_min=0.005,
                   size_max=0.03,
                   n=1000)
```
```{python message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
img = ill.autostereogram(stimulus="docs/img/depthmask.png",
                   pattern=ill.image_circles,
                   blackwhite=True,
                   alpha=0.75,
                   size_min=0.005,
                   size_max=0.03,
                   n=1000)
img.save("docs/img/README_autostereogram2.png")
```
